## Strategy Pattern

#### Situation
You have a superclass Duck (swim(), quack(), abstact display()) method and bunch of subclasses.
- New Req comes to add flying behaviour but rubber duck can't fly()
- If you add fly method in superclass, you have to track all subclasses that don't fly and override a fly() with non-flying behavior.
- If you make an interface Flyable (fly()) and implement it in all flying subclasses, you have to track down all subclasses that fly and implement fly method in each of them.
  - What if flying behaviour were to change later?

**Design Principal**
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
  - Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don’t.
  - The result? Fewer unintended consequences from code changes and more flexibility in your systems.

> All patterns provide a way to let some part of a system vary independently of all other parts.

To Separate each behavior i.e. fly() and quack() we'll create new set of classes for each behaviours implementations (**Completely separate from Duck class**)
  - Duck behavior will live in a separate class, a class that implements a particular behavior interface
  - That way duck classes won't need to know any of the implementation details for their own behaviors.

**Design Principal**
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
  - This really means is program to a supertype (Interface or Abstract Superclass)

We'll make set of classes whose entire reason for living is to represent a behavior  
Example - FlyInterface - FlyWithWings & FlyNoWay
  - This different from our previous though process where a behavior either came from a concrete implementation in the superclass or by providing specialized implementation in the subclasses itself.
  - Both cases were relying on implementation (we were locked into using that specific implementation and no room for changing behavior other than writing more code)

Duck subclasses will use a behavior represented by an interface, so that the actual implemenation of the behavior won't be locked into the Duck subclass.  

To make things clear, let's see an example  
- Imagine an Animal abstract class with Dog & Cat as its concrete implementations
- Programming to an Implemtation would be
  ```
  Dog dog = new Dog();
  dog.bark();
  ```
- But programming to an interface/supertype would be
  Animal animal = new Dog();
  animal.makeSound();
  // Dog overrides this makeSound to bark and Cat to meow
- Even better, rather than hardcoding the instantiation of the subtype (like `new Dog()`) into the code, assign the concrete implementation at object at runtime
  ```
  // We don't know what the actual animal subtype is
  Animal animal = getAnimal();
  // all we care about is that it knows how to respond to makeSound()
  animal.makeSound();
  ```

FlyBehavior Interface -> FlyWithWings, FlyNoWay
QuackBehavior Interface -> Quack, Squeak, MuteQuack
**So we get the benefit of REUSE without all the baggage that comes along with inheritance.**

With this design, other types of objects can reuse our fly and quack behaviors because these behaviors are no longer hidden away in our Duck classes! For Example - A device which makes quack sound can use the QuackBehavior
And we can add new behaviors without modifying any of our existing behavior classes or touching any of the Duck classes that use flying behaviors.


A Duck will now delegate it's flying and quacking behavior, instead of using quacking and flying methods defined in Duck class (or subclasses)  
Duck Class
  - FlyBehavior
  - QuackBehavior
  - performQuack()
  - performFly()
  - swim()
  - display()

```
public abstract class Duck {
  FlyBehavior flybehavior;
  QuackBehavior quackBehavior;

  public void performQuack() {
    // We don't care what kind of object the concrete duck is, all we care is it can perform quack
    quackBehavior.quack();
  }

  public void performFly() {
    flyBehavior.fly();
  }

  public abstract void display();

  public void swim() {
    System.out.println("All ducks float, even decoys!");
  }
}
```
SubClass Implementation
```
public class MallardDuck extends Duck {
  public MallardDuck() {
    // Use of new here is bad, later we'll learn more patterns that will help fix this
    // These should be changeable at runtime
    quackBehavior = new Quack();
    flyBehavior = new FlyWithWings();
  }

  public void display() {
    System.out.println("I'm a real Mallard duck");
  }
}
```

Beahvior Implementations
```
public class FlyWithWings implements FlyBehavior {
  public void fly() {
    System.out.println("I'm flying!!");
  }
}
```
```
public class FlyNoWay implements FlyBehavior {
  public void fly() {
    System.out.println("I can't fly");
  }
}
```
Testing
```
public class MiniDuckSimulator {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Duck mallard = new MallardDuck();
    mallard.performQuack();
    mallard.performFly();
  }
}
```

Changing behavior at Runtime (Add 2 new methods in duck class) (**Composition helped us achieve this**)
- setFlyBehavior(FlyBehavior fb)
- setQuackBehavior(QuackBehavior qb)


Thinking
- Instead of thinking duck behaviors as set of behaviors, think of it as a family of Algorithms
  - Clients make use of a family of Alogirhtms for both flying and quacking
  - Example - We can have family of Algorithms to compute sales tax for different States

Some Realtionships
- Duck HAS-A flying behavior (Same for quacking)
- FlyWithWings IMPLEMENTS FlyBehavior (Same with FlyNoWay, Quack, Squeak, MuteSqueak)
- Mallard Duck IS-A Duck


The HAS-A relationship is an interesting one: each duckhas a FlyBehavior and a QuackBehavior to which it delegates flying and quacking. When you put two classes together like this you’re using `composition`.  

**Design Principal**
Favour composition over inheritance  

As seen, creating systems using composition gives us a lot more flexibility. Not only does it let's us encapsulate a family of algorithms into their own set of classes, but it also lets us **change behavior at runtime** as long as the object you’re composing with implements the correct behavior interface.  

> As you’ve seen, inheritance has its problems, and there are other ways of achieving reuse.

### Formal Definition
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.  





#### Shared Vocabulary
Shared pattern vocabularies are POWERFUL.  
- “We’re using the Strategy Pattern to implement the various behaviors of our ducks.” This tells you the duck behavior has been encapsulated into its own set of classes that can be easily expanded and changed, even at runtime if needed.


Additional
Patterns are nothing more than using OO design principles. - **A common misconception, it's more sutle than that**


OO Basics
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

OO Principals
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favour composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations


- Good OO designs are reusable, extensible, and maintainable.
- Most patterns and principles address issues of change in software.
- Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts.
- We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.
